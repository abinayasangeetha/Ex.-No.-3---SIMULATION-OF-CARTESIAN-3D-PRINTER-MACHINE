## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

Smooth Rod : 
       A smooth rod, also known as a linear shaft or linear rod, is a key component in a 3D printer machine. It is typically made of hardened steel or other materials with low friction properties. 
Bearing : 
       In a 3D printer machine, bearings are mechanical components that facilitate smooth and precise motion. They are used to reduce friction and enable the linear movement of various parts, such as the print head, build platform, or other movable components.
Idler :
       An idler refers to a component that helps guide and tension the filament during the printing process. It is also known as a filament idler or filament tensioner.
Extruder:
       The extruder is a fundamental component of a 3D printer machine responsible for melting and depositing the filament material to create the printed object.
Motor: 
       A motor is an electromechanical device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, providing rotational or linear motion. In the context of a 3D printer machine, motors play a critical role in driving various moving parts and enabling precise movements.
       
## Y-axis assembly

Y-Axis Supporter :
       The Y-axis supporter in a 3D printer machine refers to the structural component or mechanism that supports and guides the movement along the Y-axis. 
Horiz. & Vertical Threaded Rod :
       A horizontal threaded rod is typically used in a 3D printer to drive the movement along the X-axis or Y-axis.
       A vertical threaded rod, also known as a lead screw, is commonly used to control the movement along the Z-axis in a 3D printer.
Smooth Rod :
       A smooth rod, also known as a linear shaft or linear rod, is a cylindrical component used in various applications, including 3D printer machines, CNC machines, robotics, and other precision mechanisms.
